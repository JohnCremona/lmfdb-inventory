**Todo**: Document the collections listed above (and either document or delete all others)
## General notes
* All collections contain the field `_id` which is an object of the type bson.ObjectId and uniquely identifies the record in the database. 
* All collections with names ending with .chunks contain chunks of files for GridFS for the corresponding collection with name ending with .files and will not be further described.
* All collections with names ending with .files contain data for GridFS files and will (or at least *should*) all contain the following fields (which will not be repeted below except 'filename' which has a different format in each collection):
