Status: Fields for the most recent version will change soon.  Then older versions can be deleted.

Description: These are different versions of the Artin representation databases.  They come in pairs: artrep with Artin representations and nfgal which has corresponding information about Galois groups.  A given Galois group may have several representations, so they are separated to avoid having the same information entered repeatedly.
